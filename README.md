# Null Point Analysis

This suite of analysis tools uses a combination of visit and custom python scripts to produce visualisations.

## energy-plots

These are plots of the en.dat output from lare, a continuous per-timestep dump of variables like total heating, kinetic energy, etc.

## kdes

These are kernel density estimates (closely related to histograms) of the internal energy, pulled from the .sdf files produced by lare.

## slice-*

These are slices of various variables (energy, velocity, magnetic field, etc) pulling from the .sdf files produced by lare.
